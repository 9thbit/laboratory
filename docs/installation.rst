Installation
============

Installing from `PyPI`_ is recommended.

If you're unfamiliar with Python packaging tools (such as ``pip`` and ``virtualenv``)
see what `The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python`_ has to say about them.


.. code::

    $ pip install laboratory

You can also install a `tagged version`_ from Github

.. code::

    $ pip install https://github.com/joealcorn/laboratory/archive/v1.0.tar.gz

Or the latest development version

.. code::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/joealcorn/laboratory.git
