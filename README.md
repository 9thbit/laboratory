# Laboratory! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joealcorn/laboratory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joealcorn/laboratory)

A Python library for carefully refactoring critical paths (and a port of [Github's Scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist)).


##Â But how?

Imagine you've implemented a complex caching strategy for some objects in your database and a stale cache is simply not acceptable.
How could you test this and ensure parity with your previous implementation, under load, with production data?
Run it in production!

```python
import laboratory

experiment = laboratory.Experiment()
with experiment.control() as c:
    c.record(get_objects_from_database())

with experiment.candidate() as c:
    c.record(get_objects_from_cache())

objects = experiment.run()
```

Mark the original code as the control and any other implementations as candidates. Timing information is recorded about all control
and candidate blocks, and any exceptions from the candidates will be swallowed so they don't affect availability.
Laboratory will always return the result of the control block.
