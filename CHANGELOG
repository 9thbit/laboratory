Version 1.0.1 (21-08-2018)
--------------------------
* Added: Add `randomize=True` argument to `Experiment.conduct` (thanks to Nick DiRienzo)


Version 1.0 (29-01-2018)
------------------------
* Added: Sphinx documentation & docstrings
* Added: Conditionally disable Experiments with `enabled()`
* Added: Randomised execution order of experiments.
* Breaking: Experiment control & candidate blocks are now set up in a different way without the use of context processors.
  This new API should allow some extra functionality in the future, but as a result you can no longer update
  observation context from within the tested code itself.
* Breaking: To use Experiment as a decorator you must now use the `Experiment.decorator` classmethod instead
* Breaking: Result.observations renamed to Result.candidates

  documented (https://github.com/joealcorn/laboratory/issues/10)


Version 0.4.0

* Fixed issue with observations persisting through experiment runs when
  using decorator (https://github.com/joealcorn/laboratory/pull/9)
